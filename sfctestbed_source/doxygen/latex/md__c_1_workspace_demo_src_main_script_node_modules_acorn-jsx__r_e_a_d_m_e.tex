This is plugin for \href{http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/acorn/}{\tt Acorn} -\/ a tiny, fast Java\+Script parser, written completely in Java\+Script.

It was created as an experimental alternative, faster \href{http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html}{\tt React.\+js J\+SX} parser.

According to \href{https://github.com/RReverser/acorn-jsx/blob/master/test/bench.html}{\tt benchmarks}, Acorn-\/\+J\+SX is 2x faster than official \href{https://github.com/facebook/esprima}{\tt Esprima-\/based parser} when location tracking is turned on in both (call it \char`\"{}source maps enabled mode\char`\"{}). At the same time, it consumes all the E\+S6+\+J\+SX syntax that can be consumed by Esprima-\/\+FB (this is proved by \href{https://github.com/RReverser/acorn-jsx/blob/master/test/tests-jsx.js}{\tt official tests}).

{\bfseries U\+P\+D\+A\+TE \mbox{[}14-\/\+Apr-\/2015\mbox{]}}\+: Facebook implementation started \href{https://github.com/facebook/esprima/issues/111}{\tt deprecation process} in favor of Acorn + Acorn-\/\+J\+SX + Babel for parsing and transpiling J\+SX syntax.

\subsection*{Transpiler}

Please note that this tool only parses source code to J\+SX A\+ST, which is useful for various language tools and services. If you want to transpile your code to regular E\+S5-\/compliant Java\+Script with source map, check out the \href{https://babeljs.io/}{\tt babel transpiler} which uses {\ttfamily acorn-\/jsx} under the hood.

\subsection*{Usage}

You can use module directly in order to get Acorn instance with plugin installed\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
var acorn = require('acorn-jsx');
\end{DoxyCode}


Or you can use {\ttfamily inject.\+js} for injecting plugin into your own version of Acorn like following\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
var acorn = require('acorn-jsx/inject')(require('./custom-acorn'));
\end{DoxyCode}


Then, use {\ttfamily plugins} option whenever you need to support J\+SX while parsing\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
var ast = acorn.parse(code, \{
  plugins: \{ jsx: true \}
\});
\end{DoxyCode}


Note that official spec doesn\textquotesingle{}t support mix of X\+ML namespaces and object-\/style access in tag names (\#27) like in {\ttfamily $<$namespace\+:Object.\+Property /$>$}, so it was deprecated in {\ttfamily acorn-\/jsx@3.\+0}. If you still want to opt-\/in to support of such constructions, you can pass the following option\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
var ast = acorn.parse(code, \{
  plugins: \{
    jsx: \{ allowNamespacedObjects: true \}
  \}
\});
\end{DoxyCode}


Also, since most apps use pure React transformer, a new option was introduced that allows to prohibit namespaces completely\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
var ast = acorn.parse(code, \{
  plugins: \{
    jsx: \{ allowNamespaces: false \}
  \}
\});
\end{DoxyCode}


Note that by default {\ttfamily allow\+Namespaces} is enabled for spec compliancy.

Convert from a Buffer to an Array\+Buffer as fast as possible.

Note that in some cases the returned Array\+Buffer is backed by the same memory as the original Buffer (but in other cases it is a copy), so {\bfseries modifying the Array\+Buffer is not recommended}.

This module is designed to work both in node.\+js and in all browsers with Array\+Buffer support when using \href{https://www.npmjs.com/package/buffer}{\tt the Buffer implementation provided by Browserify}.

\subsection*{Usage}

\`{}\`{}` js var to\+Array\+Buffer = require(\textquotesingle{}to-\/arraybuffer')

var buffer = new Buffer(100) // Fill the buffer with some data

var ab = to\+Array\+Buffer(buffer) // {\ttfamily ab} now contains the same data as {\ttfamily buffer} \`{}\`{}\`{}

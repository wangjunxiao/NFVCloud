\subsection*{3.\+0.\+0 (2016-\/02-\/10)}

\subsubsection*{Breaking changes}

Support for comprehension syntax (which was dropped from the draft spec) has been removed.

\subsubsection*{Fixes}

{\ttfamily let} and {\ttfamily yield} are now “contextual keywords”, meaning you can mostly use them as identifiers in E\+S5 non-\/strict code.

A parenthesized class or function expression after {\ttfamily export default} is now parsed correctly.

\subsubsection*{New features}

When {\ttfamily ecma\+Version} is set to 7, Acorn will parse the exponentiation operator ({\ttfamily $\ast$$\ast$}).

The identifier character ranges are now based on Unicode 8.\+0.\+0.

Plugins can now override the {\ttfamily raise\+Recoverable} method to override the way non-\/critical errors are handled.

\subsection*{2.\+7.\+0 (2016-\/01-\/04)}

\subsubsection*{Fixes}

Fix tokenizer support in the command-\/line tool.

In the loose parser, don\textquotesingle{}t allow non-\/string-\/literals as import sources.

Stop allowing {\ttfamily new.\+target} outside of functions.

A cross platform solution to node\textquotesingle{}s spawn and spawn\+Sync.

\subsection*{Installation}

{\ttfamily \$ npm install cross-\/spawn}

If you are using {\ttfamily spawn\+Sync} on node 0.\+10 or older, you will also need to install {\ttfamily spawn-\/sync}\+:

{\ttfamily \$ npm install spawn-\/sync}

\subsection*{Why}

Node has issues when using spawn on Windows\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item It ignores \href{https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/2318}{\tt P\+A\+T\+H\+E\+XT}
\item It does not support \href{http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang}{\tt shebangs}
\item It does not allow you to run {\ttfamily del} or {\ttfamily dir}
\item It does not properly escape arguments with spaces or special characters
\end{DoxyItemize}

All these issues are handled correctly by {\ttfamily cross-\/spawn}. There are some known modules, such as \href{https://github.com/ForbesLindesay/win-spawn}{\tt win-\/spawn}, that try to solve this but they are either broken or provide faulty escaping of shell arguments.

\subsection*{Usage}

Exactly the same way as node\textquotesingle{}s \href{https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options}{\tt {\ttfamily spawn}} or \href{https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_spawnsync_command_args_options}{\tt {\ttfamily spawn\+Sync}}, so it\textquotesingle{}s a drop in replacement.


\begin{DoxyCode}
var spawn = require('cross-spawn');

// Spawn NPM asynchronously
var child = spawn('npm', ['list', '-g', '-depth', '0'], \{ stdio: 'inherit' \});

// Spawn NPM synchronously
var results = spawn.sync('npm', ['list', '-g', '-depth', '0'], \{ stdio: 'inherit' \});
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Caveat}

On Windows, cross-\/spawn will only spawn {\ttfamily cmd.\+exe} if necessary. If the extension of the executable is {\ttfamily .exe} or {\ttfamily .com}, it will spawn it directly. If you wish to override this behavior and {\itshape always} spawn a shell, pass the {\ttfamily \{shell\+: true\}} option.

\subsection*{Tests}

{\ttfamily \$ npm test}

\#boolbase This very simple module provides two basic functions, one that always returns true ({\ttfamily true\+Func}) and one that always returns false ({\ttfamily false\+Func}).

\subsubsection*{W\+TF?}

By having only a single instance of these functions around, it\textquotesingle{}s possible to do some nice optimizations. Eg. \href{https://github.com/fb55/CSSselect}{\tt {\ttfamily C\+S\+Sselect}} uses these functions to determine whether a selector won\textquotesingle{}t match any elements. If that\textquotesingle{}s the case, the D\+OM doesn\textquotesingle{}t even have to be touched.

\subsubsection*{And why is this a separate module?}

I\textquotesingle{}m trying to modularize {\ttfamily C\+S\+Sselect} and most modules depend on these functions. I\+M\+HO, having a separate module is the easiest solution to this problem.

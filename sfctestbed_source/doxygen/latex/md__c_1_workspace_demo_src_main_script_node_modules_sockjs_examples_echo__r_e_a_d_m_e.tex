To run this example, first install dependencies\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}npm install
\end{DoxyVerb}


And run a server\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}node server.js
\end{DoxyVerb}


That will spawn an http server at \href{http://127.0.0.1:9999/}{\tt http\+://127.\+0.\+0.\+1\+:9999/} which will serve both html (served from the current directory) and also Sock\+JS server (under the \href{http://127.0.0.1:9999/echo}{\tt /echo} path).

Sort directed acyclic graphs

\href{https://travis-ci.org/marcelklehr/toposort}{\tt }

\subsection*{Installation}

{\ttfamily npm install toposort} or {\ttfamily component install marcelklehr/toposort} ~\newline
 then in your code\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
toposort = require('toposort')
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Usage}

We want to sort the following graph.




\begin{DoxyCode}
// First, we define our edges.
var graph = [
  ['put on your shoes', 'tie your shoes']
, ['put on your shirt', 'put on your jacket']
, ['put on your shorts', 'put on your jacket']
, ['put on your shorts', 'put on your shoes']
]


// Now, sort the vertices topologically, to reveal a legal execution order.
toposort(graph)
// [ 'put on your shirt'
// , 'put on your shorts'
// , 'put on your jacket'
// , 'put on your shoes'
// , 'tie your shoes' ]
\end{DoxyCode}


(Note that there is no defined order for graph parts that are not connected -- you could also put on your jacket after having tied your shoes...)

\subsubsection*{Sorting dependencies}

It is usually more convenient to specify {\itshape dependencies} instead of \char`\"{}sequences\char`\"{}. 
\begin{DoxyCode}
// This time, edges represent dependencies.
var graph = [
  ['tie your shoes', 'put on your shoes']
, ['put on your jacket', 'put on your shirt']
, ['put on your shoes', 'put on your shorts']
, ['put on your jacket', 'put on your shorts']
]

toposort(graph) 
// [ 'tie your shoes'
// , 'put on your shoes'
// , 'put on your jacket'
// , 'put on your shirt'
// , 'put on your shorts' ]

// Now, reversing the list will reveal a legal execution order.
toposort(graph).reverse() 
// [ 'put on your shorts'
// , 'put on your shirt'
// , 'put on your jacket'
// , 'put on your shoes'
// , 'tie your shoes' ]
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{A\+PI}

\subsubsection*{toposort(edges)}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item edges \{Array\} An array of directed edges describing a graph. An edge looks like this\+: {\ttfamily \mbox{[}node1, node2\mbox{]}} (vertices needn\textquotesingle{}t be strings but can be of any type).
\end{DoxyItemize}

Returns\+: \{Array\} a list of vertices, sorted from \char`\"{}start\char`\"{} to \char`\"{}end\char`\"{}

\subsubsection*{toposort.\+array(nodes, edges)}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item nodes \{Array\} An array of nodes
\item edges \{Array\} An array of directed edges. You don\textquotesingle{}t need to mention all {\ttfamily nodes} here.
\end{DoxyItemize}

This is a convenience method that allows you to define nodes that may or may not be connected to any other nodes. The ordering of unconnected nodes is not defined.

Returns\+: \{Array\} a list of vertices, sorted from \char`\"{}start\char`\"{} to \char`\"{}end\char`\"{}

\subsection*{Tests}

Run the tests with {\ttfamily node test.\+js}.

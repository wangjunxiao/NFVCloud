Decorators allow for blocks to be annotated with metadata or wrapped in functionality prior to execution of the block. This may be used to communicate with the containing helper or to setup a particular state in the system prior to running the block.

Decorators are registered through similar methods as helpers, {\ttfamily register\+Decorators} and {\ttfamily unregister\+Decorators}. These can then be referenced via the friendly name in the template using the {\ttfamily \{\{$\ast$ decorator\}\}} and {\ttfamily \{\{\#$\ast$ decorator\}\}\{/decorator\}\}} syntaxes. These syntaxes are derivatives of the normal mustache syntax and as such have all of the same argument and whitespace behaviors.

Decorators are executed when the block program is instantiated and are passed {\ttfamily (program, props, container, context, data, block\+Params, depths)}.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily program}\+: The block to wrap
\item {\ttfamily props}\+: Object used to set metadata on the final function. Any values set on this object will be set on the function, regardless of if the original function is replaced or not. Metadata should be applied using this object as values applied to {\ttfamily program} may be masked by subsequent decorators that may wrap {\ttfamily program}.
\item {\ttfamily container}\+: The current runtime container
\item {\ttfamily context}\+: The current context. Since the decorator is run before the block that contains it, this is the parent context.
\item {\ttfamily data}\+: The current {\ttfamily @data} values
\item {\ttfamily block\+Params}\+: The current block parameters stack
\item {\ttfamily depths}\+: The current context stack
\end{DoxyItemize}

Decorators may set values on {\ttfamily props} or return a modified function that wraps {\ttfamily program} in particular behaviors. If the decorator returns nothing, then {\ttfamily program} is left unaltered.

The \href{https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/blob/master/lib/handlebars/decorators/inline.js}{\tt inline partial} implementation provides an example of decorators being used for both metadata and wrapping behaviors.

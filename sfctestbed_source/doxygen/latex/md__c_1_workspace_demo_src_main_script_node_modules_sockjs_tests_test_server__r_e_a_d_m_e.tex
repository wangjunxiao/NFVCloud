In order to test sockjs server implementation the server needs to provide a standarized sockjs endpoint that will can used by various sockjs-\/related tests. For example by Q\+Unit or \href{https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-protocol}{\tt Sockjs-\/protocol} tests.

This small code does exactly that -\/ runs a simple server that supports the following Sock\+JS services\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily /echo}
\item {\ttfamily /disabled\+\_\+websocket\+\_\+echo}
\item {\ttfamily /cookie\+\_\+needed\+\_\+echo}
\item {\ttfamily /close}
\item {\ttfamily /ticker}
\item {\ttfamily /amplify}
\item {\ttfamily /broadcast}
\end{DoxyItemize}

If you just want to quickly run it\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}npm install
node server.js
\end{DoxyVerb}


If you want to run do development it\textquotesingle{}s recommended to run {\ttfamily make test\+\_\+server} from the top {\ttfamily sockjs-\/node} directory\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}cd ../..
make test_server\end{DoxyVerb}

{\ttfamily fb-\/watchman} is a filesystem watcher that uses the \href{https://facebook.github.io/watchman/}{\tt Watchman} file watching service from Facebook.

Watchman provides file change notification services using very efficient recursive watches and also allows more advanced change matching and filesystem tree querying operations using \href{https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/file-query.html#expressions}{\tt a powerful expression syntax}.

\subsection*{Install}

You should \href{https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html}{\tt install Watchman} to make the most of this module.

Then simply\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
$ npm install fb-watchman
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Key Concepts}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Watchman recursively watches directories.
\item Each watched directory is called a {\ttfamily root}.
\item You must initiate a {\ttfamily watch} on a {\ttfamily root} using the {\ttfamily watch-\/project} command prior to subscribing to changes
\item Rather than separately watching many sibling directories, {\ttfamily watch-\/project} consolidates and re-\/uses existing watches relative to a project root (the location of your {\ttfamily .watchmanconfig} or source control repository root)
\item change notifications are relative to the project root
\end{DoxyItemize}

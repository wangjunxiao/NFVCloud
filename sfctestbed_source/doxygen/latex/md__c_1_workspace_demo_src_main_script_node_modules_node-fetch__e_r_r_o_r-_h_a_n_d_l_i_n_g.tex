Because {\ttfamily window.\+fetch} isn\textquotesingle{}t designed to transparent about the cause of request errors, we have to come up with our own solutions.

The basics\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item All \href{https://www.joyent.com/node-js/production/design/errors}{\tt operational errors} are rejected as \href{https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch/blob/master/lib/fetch-error.js}{\tt Fetch\+Error}, you can handle them all through promise {\ttfamily catch} clause.
\item All errors comes with {\ttfamily err.\+message} detailing the cause of errors.
\item All errors originated from {\ttfamily node-\/fetch} are marked with custom {\ttfamily err.\+type}.
\item All errors originated from Node.\+js core are marked with {\ttfamily err.\+type = system}, and contains addition {\ttfamily err.\+code} and {\ttfamily err.\+errno} for error handling, they are alias to error codes thrown by Node.\+js core.
\item \href{https://www.joyent.com/node-js/production/design/errors}{\tt Programmer errors} are either thrown as soon as possible, or rejected with default {\ttfamily Error} with {\ttfamily err.\+message} for ease of troubleshooting.
\end{DoxyItemize}

List of error types\+:

\item Because we maintain 100\% coverage, see \href{https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch/blob/master/test/test.js}{\tt test.\+js} for a full list of custom {\ttfamily Fetch\+Error} types, as well as some of the common errors from Node.\+js

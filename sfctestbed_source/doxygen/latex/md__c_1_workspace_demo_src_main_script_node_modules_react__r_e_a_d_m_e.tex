An npm package to get you immediate access to \href{https://facebook.github.io/react/}{\tt React}, without also requiring the J\+SX transformer. This is especially useful for cases where you want to \href{https://github.com/substack/node-browserify}{\tt {\ttfamily browserify}} your module using {\ttfamily React}.

{\bfseries Note\+:} by default, React will be in development mode. The development version includes extra warnings about common mistakes, whereas the production version includes extra performance optimizations and strips all error messages.

To use React in production mode, set the environment variable {\ttfamily N\+O\+D\+E\+\_\+\+E\+NV} to {\ttfamily production}. A minifier that performs dead-\/code elimination such as \href{https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2}{\tt Uglify\+JS} is recommended to completely remove the extra code present in development mode.

\subsection*{Example Usage}


\begin{DoxyCode}
var React = require('react');
\end{DoxyCode}

Memoize the results of a call to the Reg\+Exp constructor, avoiding repetitious runtime compilation of the same string and options, resulting in suprising performance improvements. \end{quote}


\subsection*{Install}

Install with \href{https://www.npmjs.com/}{\tt npm}\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
$ npm install regex-cache --save
\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Read \href{#what-this-does}{\tt what this does}.
\item See \href{#benchmarks}{\tt the benchmarks}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Usage}

Wrap a function like this\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
var cache = require('regex-cache');
var someRegex = cache(require('some-regex-lib'));
\end{DoxyCode}


{\bfseries Caching a regex}

If you want to cache a regex after calling {\ttfamily new Reg\+Exp()}, or you\textquotesingle{}re requiring a module that returns a regex, wrap it with a function first\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
var cache = require('regex-cache');

function yourRegex(str, opts) \{
  // do stuff to str and opts
  return new RegExp(str, opts.flags);
\}

var regex = cache(yourRegex);
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Recommendations}

\subsubsection*{Use this when...}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries No options are passed} to the function that creates the regex. Regardless of how big or small the regex is, when zero options are passed, caching will be faster than not.
\item {\bfseries A few options are passed}, and the values are primitives. The limited benchmarks I did show that caching is beneficial when up to 8 or 9 options are passed.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Do not use this when...}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries The values of options are not primitives}. When non-\/primitives must be compared for equality, the time to compare the options is most likely as long or longer than the time to just create a new regex.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Example benchmarks}

\subsection*{Run benchmarks}

Install dev dependencies\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
npm i -d && npm run benchmarks
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{What this does}

If you\textquotesingle{}re using `new Reg\+Exp(\textquotesingle{}foo')\`{} instead of a regex literal, it\textquotesingle{}s probably because you need to dyamically generate a regex based on user options or some other potentially changing factors.

When your function creates a string based on user inputs and passes it to the {\ttfamily Reg\+Exp} constructor, regex-\/cache caches the results. The next time the function is called if the key of a cached regex matches the user input (or no input was given), the cached regex is returned, avoiding unnecessary runtime compilation.

Using the Reg\+Exp constructor offers a lot of flexibility, but the runtime compilation comes at a price -\/ it\textquotesingle{}s slow. Not specifically because of the call to the Reg\+Exp constructor, but {\bfseries because you have to build up the string before {\ttfamily new Reg\+Exp()} is even called}. \subsection*{Contributing}

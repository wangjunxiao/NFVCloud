This release includes a minor fix for indentations when stringifying empty arrays.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix\+: Indents no longer appear in empty arrays when stringified. (\mbox{[}\#134\mbox{]})

This release includes major internal changes and public A\+PI enhancements.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries Major\+:} J\+S\+O\+N5 officially supports Node.\+js v4 L\+TS and v5. Support for Node.\+js v0.\+6 and v0.\+8 have been dropped, while support for v0.\+10 and v0.\+12 remain.
\item Fix\+: Y\+UI Compressor no longer fails when compressing json5.\+js. (\href{https://github.com/aseemk/json5/pull/97}{\tt \#97})
\item New\+: {\ttfamily parse} and the C\+LI provide line and column numbers when displaying error messages. (\href{https://github.com/aseemk/json5/pull/101}{\tt \#101}; awesome work by \href{https://github.com/amb26}{\tt }.)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{v0.\+4.\+0 \mbox{[}\href{https://github.com/aseemk/json5/tree/v0.4.0}{\tt code}, \href{https://github.com/aseemk/json5/compare/v0.2.0...v0.4.0}{\tt diff}\mbox{]}}

Note that v0.\+3.\+0 was tagged, but never published to npm, so this v0.\+4.\+0 changelog entry includes v0.\+3.\+0 features.

This is a massive release that adds {\ttfamily stringify} support, among other things.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries Major\+:} {\ttfamily J\+S\+O\+N5.\+stringify()} now exists! This method is analogous to the native {\ttfamily J\+S\+O\+N.\+stringify()}; it just avoids quoting keys where possible. See the \href{./README.md#usage}{\tt usage documentation} for more. (\href{https://github.com/aseemk/json5/issues/32}{\tt \#32}; huge thanks and props \href{https://github.com/aeisenberg}{\tt }!)
\item New\+: {\ttfamily NaN} and {\ttfamily -\/\+NaN} are now allowed number literals. (\href{https://github.com/aseemk/json5/issues/30}{\tt \#30}; thanks \href{https://github.com/rowanhill}{\tt }.)
\item New\+: Duplicate object keys are now allowed; the last value is used. This is the same behavior as J\+S\+ON. (\href{https://github.com/aseemk/json5/issues/57}{\tt \#57}; thanks \href{https://github.com/jordanbtucker}{\tt }.)
\item Fix\+: Properly handle various whitespace and newline cases now. E.\+g. J\+S\+O\+N5 now properly supports escaped CR and C\+R\+LF newlines in strings, and J\+S\+O\+N5 now accepts the same whitespace as J\+S\+ON (stricter than E\+S5). (\href{https://github.com/aseemk/json5/pull/58}{\tt \#58}, \href{https://github.com/aseemk/json5/pull/60}{\tt \#60}, and \href{https://github.com/aseemk/json5/pull/63}{\tt \#63}; thanks \href{https://github.com/jordanbtucker}{\tt }.)
\item New\+: Negative hexadecimal numbers (e.\+g. {\ttfamily -\/0x\+C8}) are allowed again. (They were disallowed in v0.\+2.\+0; see below.) It turns out they {\itshape are} valid in E\+S5, so J\+S\+O\+N5 supports them now too. (\href{https://github.com/aseemk/json5/issues/36}{\tt \#36}; thanks \href{https://github.com/jordanbtucker}{\tt }!)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{v0.\+2.\+0 \mbox{[}\href{https://github.com/aseemk/json5/tree/v0.2.0}{\tt code}, \href{https://github.com/aseemk/json5/compare/v0.1.0...v0.2.0}{\tt diff}\mbox{]}}

This release fixes some bugs and adds some more utility features to help you express data more easily\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries Breaking\+:} Negative hexadecimal numbers (e.\+g. {\ttfamily -\/0x\+C8}) are rejected now. While V8 (e.\+g. Chrome and Node) supported them, it turns out they\textquotesingle{}re invalid in E\+S5. This has been \href{http://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=2240}{\tt fixed in V8} (and by extension, Chrome and Node), so J\+S\+O\+N5 officially rejects them now, too. (\href{https://github.com/aseemk/json5/issues/36}{\tt \#36})
\item New\+: Trailing decimal points in decimal numbers are allowed again. (They were disallowed in v0.\+1.\+0; see below.) They\textquotesingle{}re allowed by E\+S5, and differentiating between integers and floats may make sense on some platforms. (\href{https://github.com/aseemk/json5/issues/16}{\tt \#16}; thanks \href{https://github.com/Midar}{\tt }.)
\item New\+: {\ttfamily Infinity} and {\ttfamily -\/\+Infinity} are now allowed number literals. (\href{https://github.com/aseemk/json5/issues/30}{\tt \#30}; thanks \href{https://github.com/pepkin88}{\tt }.)
\item New\+: Plus signs ({\ttfamily +}) in front of numbers are now allowed, since it can be helpful in some contexts to explicitly mark numbers as positive. (E.\+g. when a property represents changes or deltas.)
\item Fix\+: unescaped newlines in strings are rejected now. (\href{https://github.com/aseemk/json5/issues/24}{\tt \#24}; thanks \href{https://github.com/Midar}{\tt }.)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{v0.\+1.\+0 \mbox{[}\href{https://github.com/aseemk/json5/tree/v0.1.0}{\tt code}, \href{https://github.com/aseemk/json5/compare/v0.0.1...v0.1.0}{\tt diff}\mbox{]}}

This release tightens J\+S\+O\+N5 support and adds helpful utility features\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item New\+: Support hexadecimal numbers. (Thanks \href{https://github.com/MaxNanasy}{\tt }.)
\item Fix\+: Reject octal numbers properly now. Previously, they were accepted but improperly parsed as base-\/10 numbers. (Thanks \href{https://github.com/MaxNanasy}{\tt }.)
\item {\bfseries Breaking\+:} Reject \char`\"{}noctal\char`\"{} numbers now (base-\/10 numbers that begin with a leading zero). These are disallowed by both J\+S\+O\+N5 and J\+S\+ON, as well as by E\+S5\textquotesingle{}s strict mode. (Thanks \href{https://github.com/MaxNanasy}{\tt }.)
\item New\+: Support leading decimal points in decimal numbers. (Thanks \href{https://github.com/MaxNanasy}{\tt }.)
\item {\bfseries Breaking\+:} Reject trailing decimal points in decimal numbers now. These are disallowed by both J\+S\+O\+N5 and J\+S\+ON. (Thanks \href{https://github.com/MaxNanasy}{\tt }.)
\item {\bfseries Breaking\+:} Reject omitted elements in arrays now. These are disallowed by both J\+S\+O\+N5 and J\+S\+ON.
\item Fix\+: Throw proper {\ttfamily Syntax\+Error} instances on errors now.
\item New\+: Add Node.\+js {\ttfamily require()} hook. Register via {\ttfamily json5/lib/require}.
\item New\+: Add Node.\+js {\ttfamily json5} executable to compile J\+S\+O\+N5 files to J\+S\+ON.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{v0.\+0.\+1 \mbox{[}\href{https://github.com/aseemk/json5/tree/v0.0.1}{\tt code}, \href{https://github.com/aseemk/json5/compare/v0.0.0...v0.0.1}{\tt diff}\mbox{]}}

This was the first implementation of this J\+S\+O\+N5 parser.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Support unquoted object keys, including reserved words. Unicode characters and escape sequences sequences aren\textquotesingle{}t yet supported.
\item Support single-\/quoted strings.
\item Support multi-\/line strings.
\item Support trailing commas in arrays and objects.
\item Support comments, both inline and block.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Let\textquotesingle{}s consider this to be Douglas Crockford\textquotesingle{}s original \href{https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js/blob/master/json_parse.js}{\tt json\+\_\+parse.\+js} â€” a parser for the regular J\+S\+ON format.

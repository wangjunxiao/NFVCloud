 webpack is a module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle Java\+Script files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset. 

 

\subsection*{Install}


\begin{DoxyCode}
npm install --save-dev webpack
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Introduction}

The R\+E\+A\+D\+ME reflects webpack v2.\+x, webpack v1.\+x \href{https://webpack.github.io/docs/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=top}{\tt documentation can be found here}. \end{quote}


webpack is a bundler for modules. The main purpose is to bundle Java\+Script files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.

{\bfseries TL;DR}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Bundles \href{http://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html}{\tt ES Modules}, \href{http://wiki.commonjs.org/}{\tt Common\+JS} and \href{https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD}{\tt A\+MD} modules (even combined).
\item Can create a single bundle or multiple chunks that are asynchronously loaded at runtime (to reduce initial loading time).
\item Dependencies are resolved during compilation, reducing the runtime size.
\item Loaders can preprocess files while compiling, e.\+g. Type\+Script to Java\+Script, Handlebars strings to compiled functions, images to Base64, etc.
\item Highly modular plugin system to do whatever else your application requires.

\subsection*{Concepts}

\subsubsection*{\href{https://webpack.js.org/plugins/}{\tt Plugins}}

webpack has a \href{https://webpack.js.org/plugins/}{\tt rich plugin interface}. Most of the features within webpack itself use this plugin interface. This makes webpack very {\bfseries flexible}.

\end{longtabu}


\subsubsection*{\href{https://webpack.js.org/loaders/}{\tt Loaders}}

webpack enables use of loaders to preprocess files. This allows you to bundle {\bfseries any static resource} way beyond Java\+Script. You can easily \href{https://webpack.js.org/api/loaders/}{\tt write your own loaders} using Node.\+js.

Loaders are activated by using {\ttfamily loadername!} prefixes in {\ttfamily require()} statements, or are automatically applied via regex from your webpack configuration.

\subsubsection*{Performance}

webpack uses async I/O and has multiple caching levels. This makes webpack fast and incredibly {\bfseries fast} on incremental compilations.

\subsubsection*{Module Formats}

webpack supports E\+S2015+, Common\+JS and A\+MD modules {\bfseries out of the box}. It performs clever static analysis on the A\+ST of your code. It even has an evaluation engine to evaluate simple expressions. This allows you to {\bfseries support most existing libraries} out of the box.

\subsubsection*{\href{https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/}{\tt Code Splitting}}

webpack allows you to split your codebase into multiple chunks. Chunks are loaded asynchronously at runtime. This reduces the initial loading time.

\subsubsection*{\href{https://webpack.js.org/guides/production-build/}{\tt Optimizations}}

webpack can do many optimizations to {\bfseries reduce the output size of your Java\+Script} by deduplicating frequently used modules, minifying, and giving you full control of what is loaded initially and what is loaded at runtime through code splitting. It can also make your code chunks {\bfseries cache friendly} by using hashes.

\subsection*{Contributing}

Most of the time, if webpack is not working correctly for you it is a simple configuration issue.

If you are still having difficulty after looking over your configuration carefully, please post a question to \href{https://stackoverflow.com/tags/webpack}{\tt Stack\+Overflow with the webpack tag}. Questions that include your webpack.\+config.\+js and relevant files are more likely to receive responses.

If you have discovered a bug or have a feature suggestion, feel free to create an issue on Github.

If you create a loader or plugin, please consider open sourcing it, putting it on npm and following the {\ttfamily x-\/loader}, {\ttfamily x-\/webpack-\/plugin} convention.

You are also welcome to correct any spelling mistakes or any language issues.

If you want to discuss something or just need help, \href{https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack}{\tt here is our Gitter room}.

\item for \href{https://code.google.com/archive/p/google-web-toolkit}{\tt Google Web Toolkit (G\+WT)}, which aims to compile Java to Java\+Script. It features a similar \href{http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/DevGuideCodeSplitting.html}{\tt Code Splitting} as webpack.
\item for \href{https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake}{\tt modules-\/webmake}, which is a similar project. webpack was born because I wanted Code Splitting for modules-\/webmake. Interestingly the \href{https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake/issues/7}{\tt Code Splitting issue is still open} (thanks also to  for the discussion).
\item for \href{http://browserify.org/}{\tt browserify}, which is a similar project and source for many ideas.
\item for \href{http://requirejs.org/}{\tt require.\+js}, which is a similar project and source for many ideas.
\item for the \href{https://gist.github.com/defunctzombie/4339901}{\tt browser-\/field spec}, which makes modules available for node.\+js, browserify and webpack.
\item Every early webpack user, which contributed to webpack by writing issues or P\+Rs. You influenced the direction...
\item ,  and  for maintaining this project
\item Everyone who has written a loader for webpack. You are the ecosystem...
\item Everyone I forgot to mention here, but also influenced webpack.

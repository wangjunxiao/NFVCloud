C\+S\+S\+Style\+Declaration is a work-\/a-\/like to the C\+S\+S\+Style\+Declaration class in Nikita Vasilyev\textquotesingle{}s \href{https://github.com/NV/CSSOM}{\tt C\+S\+S\+OM}. I made it so that when using \href{https://github.com/tmtk75/node-jquery}{\tt j\+Query in node} setting css attributes via \$.fn.\+css() would work. node-\/jquery uses \href{https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom}{\tt jsdom} to create a D\+OM to use in node. jsdom uses C\+S\+S\+OM for styling, and C\+S\+S\+OM\textquotesingle{}s implementation of the \href{http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/css.html#CSS-CSSStyleDeclaration}{\tt C\+S\+S\+Style\+Declaration} doesn\textquotesingle{}t support \href{http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/css.html#CSS-CSS2Properties}{\tt C\+S\+S2\+Properties}, which is how j\+Query\textquotesingle{}s \href{http://api.jquery.com/css/}{\tt \$.fn.\+css()} operates.

\subsection*{Why not just issue a pull request? }

Well, NV wants to keep C\+S\+S\+OM fast (which I can appreciate) and C\+S\+S2\+Properties aren\textquotesingle{}t required by the standard (though every browser has the interface). So I figured the path of least resistence would be to just modify this one class, publish it as a node module (that requires C\+S\+S\+OM) and then make a pull request of jsdom to use it.

\subsection*{How do I test this code? }

{\ttfamily npm test} should do the trick, assuming you have the dev dependencies installed\+: \begin{quote}
\`{}\`{}\`{} \$ npm test

tests ✔ Verify Has Properties ✔ Verify Has Functions ✔ Verify Has Special Properties ✔ Test From Style String ✔ Test From Properties ✔ Test Shorthand Properties ✔ Test width and height Properties and null and empty strings ✔ Test Implicit Properties \`{}\`{}\`{}\end{quote}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Replaced the {\ttfamily has-\/own} module with {\ttfamily has}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\#Â 2.1.\+6


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes an issue where the module would discard at-\/rules that were defined in {\ttfamily @media} \& {\ttfamily @supports} rules as well as the root. As this is legal to do in C\+SS, the module now checks to see if the candidate rule has the same parent as the cached rule. If it does, the rules are merged.

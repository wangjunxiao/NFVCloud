\end{DoxyItemize}

\# 2.0.\+0

This release contains the following breaking changes\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Renamed all {\ttfamily each\+Inside} iterators to {\ttfamily walk}. For example, {\ttfamily each\+Tag} is now {\ttfamily walk\+Tags}, and {\ttfamily each\+Inside} is now {\ttfamily walk}.
\item Renamed {\ttfamily Node\+::remove\+Self()} to {\ttfamily Node\+::remove()}.
\item Renamed {\ttfamily Container\+::remove()} to {\ttfamily Container\+::remove\+Child()}.
\item Renamed {\ttfamily Node\+::raw} to {\ttfamily Node\+::raws} (thanks to ).
\item Now parses {\ttfamily \&} as the {\itshape nesting} selector, rather than a {\itshape tag} selector.
\item Fixes misinterpretation of Sass interpolation (e.\+g. {\ttfamily \#\{foo\}}) as an id selector (thanks to ).
\end{DoxyItemize}

and;


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes parsing of attribute selectors with equals signs in them (e.\+g. {\ttfamily \mbox{[}data-\/attr=\char`\"{}foo=bar\char`\"{}\mbox{]}}) (thanks to ).
\item Adds {\ttfamily quoted} and {\ttfamily raw.\+unquoted} properties to attribute nodes (thanks to ).
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{1.\+3.\+3}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes an infinite loop on {\ttfamily )} and {\ttfamily \mbox{]}} tokens when they had no opening pairs. Now postcss-\/selector-\/parser will throw when it encounters these lone tokens.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\# 1.3.\+2


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Now uses plain integers rather than {\ttfamily str.\+char\+Code\+At(0)} for compiled builds.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{1.\+3.\+1}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Update flatten to v1.\+x (thanks to ).
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{1.\+3.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Adds a new node type, {\ttfamily String}, to fix a crash on selectors such as {\ttfamily foo\+:bar(\char`\"{}test\char`\"{})}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{1.\+2.\+1}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes a crash when the parser encountered a trailing combinator.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{1.\+2.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A more descriptive error is thrown when the parser expects to find a pseudo-\/class/pseudo-\/element (thanks to ).
\item Adds support for line/column locations for selector nodes, as well as a {\ttfamily Node\+::source\+Index} method (thanks to ).
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{1.\+1.\+4}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes a crash when a selector started with a {\ttfamily $>$} combinator. The module will now no longer throw if a selector has a leading/trailing combinator node.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{1.\+1.\+3}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes a crash on {\ttfamily @} tokens.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{1.\+1.\+2}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes an infinite loop caused by using parentheses in a non-\/pseudo element context.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{1.\+1.\+1}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes a crash when a backslash ended a selector string.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{1.\+1.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Adds support for replacing multiple nodes at once with {\ttfamily replace\+With} (thanks to ).

\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{0.\+0.\+4}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Tidy up redundant duplication.
\item Fixes a bug where the parser would loop infinitely on universal selectors inside pseudo selectors.

\item Refactors how namespaces are handled for consistency \& less redundant code.
\item Refactors A\+ST to use {\ttfamily nodes} exclusively, and eliminates excessive nesting.

\subsection*{Usage in Create React App Projects}

The easiest way to use this configuration is with \href{https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app}{\tt Create React App}, which includes it by default. {\bfseries You don’t need to install it separately in Create React App projects.}

\subsection*{Usage Outside of Create React App}

If you want to use this Babel preset in a project not built with Create React App, you can install it with following steps.

First, \href{https://babeljs.io/docs/setup/}{\tt install Babel}.

Then create a file named {\ttfamily .babelrc} with following contents in the root folder of your project\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
\{
  "presets": ["react-app"]
\}
\end{DoxyCode}


This preset uses the {\ttfamily use\+Built\+Ins} option with \href{http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-object-rest-spread/}{\tt transform-\/object-\/rest-\/spread} and \href{http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-react-jsx/}{\tt transform-\/react-\/jsx}, which assumes that {\ttfamily Object.\+assign} is available or polyfilled.

Enforce img alt attribute does not contain the word image, picture, or photo. Screenreaders already announce {\ttfamily img} elements as an image. There is no need to use words such as {\itshape image}, {\itshape photo}, and/or {\itshape picture}.

\subsection*{Rule details}

This rule takes one optional object argument of type object\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
\{
    "rules": \{
        "jsx-a11y/img-redundant-alt": [ 2, \{
            "components": [ "Image" ],
            "words": [ "Bild", "Foto" ],
          \}],
    \}
\}
\end{DoxyCode}


For the {\ttfamily components} option, these strings determine which J\+SX elements ({\bfseries always including} {\ttfamily $<$img$>$}) should be checked for having redundant words in the {\ttfamily alt} prop value . This is a good use case when you have a wrapper component that simply renders an {\ttfamily img} element (like in React).

For the {\ttfamily words} option, these strings can be used to specify custom words that should be checked for in the alt prop, including {\ttfamily image}, {\ttfamily photo}, and {\ttfamily picture}. Useful for specifying words in other languages.

The rule will first check if {\ttfamily aria-\/hidden} is true to determine whether to enforce the rule. If the image is hidden, then rule will always succeed.

\#\#\# Succeed 
\begin{DoxyCode}
<img src="foo" alt="Foo eating a sandwich." />
<img src="bar" aria-hidden alt="Picture of me taking a photo of an image" /> // Will pass because it is
       hidden.
<img src="baz" alt=\{`Baz taking a $\{photo\}`\} /> // This is valid since photo is a variable name.
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsubsection*{Fail}


\begin{DoxyCode}
<img src="foo" alt="Photo of foo being weird." />
<img src="bar" alt="Image of me at a bar!" />
<img src="baz" alt="Picture of baz fixing a bug." />
\end{DoxyCode}

Node.\+js (v0.\+8 and v0.\+10) had some bugs and issues with the default \href{http://nodejs.org/api/readline.html}{\tt Readline} module.

This module include fixes seen in later version (0.\+11-\/0.\+12 and iojs) and ease some undesirable behavior one could see using the readline to create interatives prompts. This means {\ttfamily readline2} change some behaviors and as so is {\bfseries not} meant to be an exact drop-\/in replacement.

This project is extracted from the core of \href{https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js}{\tt Inquirer.\+js interactive prompt interface} to be available as a standalone module.

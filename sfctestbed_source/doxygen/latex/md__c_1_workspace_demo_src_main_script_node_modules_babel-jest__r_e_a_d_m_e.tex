\href{https://github.com/babel/babel}{\tt Babel} \href{https://github.com/facebook/jest}{\tt jest} plugin

\subsection*{Usage}

If you are already using {\ttfamily jest-\/cli}, just add {\ttfamily babel-\/jest} and it will automatically compile Java\+Script code using babel.


\begin{DoxyCode}
npm install --save-dev babel-jest
\end{DoxyCode}


If you would like to write your own preprocessor, uninstall and delete babel-\/jest and set the \href{http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/configuration.html#transform-object-string-string}{\tt config.\+transform} option to your preprocessor.

\subsection*{Setup}

{\itshape Note\+: this step is only required if you are using {\ttfamily babel-\/jest} with additional code preprocessors.}

To explicitly define {\ttfamily babel-\/jest} as a transformer for your Java\+Script code, map $\ast$.js$\ast$ files to the {\ttfamily babel-\/jest} module.


\begin{DoxyCode}
"transform": \{
  "^.+\(\backslash\)\(\backslash\).jsx?$": "babel-jest"
\},
\end{DoxyCode}

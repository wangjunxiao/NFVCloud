\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Performance improvements; no compatibility checking for simple selectors, cached compatibility lookups, and early exit on compatibility mismatches (thanks to ).
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{2.\+1.\+1}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Resolves an issue with {\ttfamily 2.\+1.\+0} where {\ttfamily browserslist} was not being installed correctly on older Node versions.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{2.\+1.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Rules are now merged based on supported browsers, which uses {\ttfamily browserslist} \& {\ttfamily caniuse-\/api}. The browsers should be supplied by the standard means of \href{https://github.com/ai/browserslist#config-file}{\tt configuring {\ttfamily browserslist}}, either using config files or via environment variables.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{2.\+0.\+11}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Resolves an issue where partially identical properties would be removed from a rule erroneously; for example {\ttfamily color\+: \#fff} would be removed if the other rule contained {\ttfamily background-\/color\+: \#fff}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{2.\+0.\+10}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Replaces the internal list of vendor prefixes with the {\ttfamily vendors} module (now, some less widely used prefixes are supported).
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{2.\+0.\+9}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Resolves an issue where the module would merge rules that had colliding vendor prefixed properties and specification properties.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{2.\+0.\+8}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Resolves an issue where selectors inside {\ttfamily @keyframes} would be merged, causing a break in Safari.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{2.\+0.\+7}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Resolves an issue where merging was not respecting property order, in cases where both shorthand definitions and longhand definitions existed. Now, these cases will not be merged (thanks to @11bit).
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{2.\+0.\+6}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes an issue where forward merging was not checking that the merge candidate was safe to merge (either contains no vendor prefixes, or the same vendor prefixes).
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{2.\+0.\+5}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Replaced Post\+C\+SS\textquotesingle{} {\ttfamily clone\+Before} with custom clone method to handle {\ttfamily null} values properly.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{2.\+0.\+4}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes a crash when cloning a {\ttfamily null} object property (thanks to ).
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{2.\+0.\+3}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed an issue where the module was incorrectly merging across {\ttfamily @font-\/face} at-\/rules.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{2.\+0.\+2}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed an issue where keyframes with the same name were being merged together incorrectly.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{2.\+0.\+1}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed a crash when {\ttfamily rule.\+nodes} was not defined.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{2.\+0.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Upgraded to Post\+C\+SS 5.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{1.\+3.\+6}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Minor boost in performance with reduced stringify passes.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{1.\+3.\+5}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Improves merging of adjacent rules with identical selectors.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{1.\+3.\+4}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes an issue where in some cases, non-\/adjacent rule merging was being performed.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{1.\+3.\+3}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes an issue where the wildcard hack ({\ttfamily $\ast$zoom\+: 1}) was being propagated to other properties erroneously.
\item Better merging logic in some cases.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{1.\+3.\+2}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes a behaviour in which comment nodes were being processed by the partial declaration merging logic.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{1.\+3.\+1}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes a behaviour in which rule adjacent forward nodes were not being type checked before they were merged.
\item Compatibility fixes for the Post\+C\+SS plugin guidelines.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{1.\+3.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Better support for merging properties without the existance of a shorthand override.
\item Can now \textquotesingle{}merge forward\textquotesingle{} adjacent rules as well as the previous \textquotesingle{}merge behind\textquotesingle{} behaviour, leading to better compression.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{1.\+2.\+2}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed an issue where the plugin crashed if node.\+parent was undefined.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{1.\+2.\+1}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed a bug where media queries were being merged when their parameters were different.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{1.\+2.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Now uses the Post\+C\+SS {\ttfamily 4.\+1} plugin A\+PI.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{1.\+1.\+1}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Bugfix of last release, now difference is calculated in both directions.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{1.\+1.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Less eager moving of properties, to avoid cases where moving a longhand property would allow a shorthand property to override it.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{1.\+0.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Initial release.

 \href{https://github.com/webpack/webpack}{\tt } \section*{webpack Dev Server}

 

Use \href{https://webpack.js.org}{\tt webpack} with a development server that provides live reloading. This should be used for {\bfseries development only}.

It uses \href{https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware}{\tt webpack-\/dev-\/middleware} under the hood, which provides fast in-\/memory access to the webpack assets.

\subsection*{Install}


\begin{DoxyCode}
npm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Usage}

The easiest way to use it is with the C\+LI. In the directory where your {\ttfamily webpack.\+config.\+js} is, run\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
node\_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server
\end{DoxyCode}


This will start a server, listening on connections from {\ttfamily localhost} on port {\ttfamily 8080}.

Now, when you change something in your assets, it should live-\/reload the files.

See \href{https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserver}{\tt {\bfseries the documentation}} for more use cases and options.

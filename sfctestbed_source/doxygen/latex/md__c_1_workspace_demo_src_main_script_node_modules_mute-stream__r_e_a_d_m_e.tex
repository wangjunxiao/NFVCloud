Bytes go in, but they don\textquotesingle{}t come out (when muted).

This is a basic pass-\/through stream, but when muted, the bytes are silently dropped, rather than being passed through.

\subsection*{Usage}


\begin{DoxyCode}
var MuteStream = require('mute-stream')

var ms = new MuteStream(options)

ms.pipe(process.stdout)
ms.write('foo') // writes 'foo' to stdout
ms.mute()
ms.write('bar') // does not write 'bar'
ms.unmute()
ms.write('baz') // writes 'baz' to stdout

// can also be used to mute incoming data
var ms = new MuteStream
input.pipe(ms)

ms.on('data', function (c) \{
  console.log('data: ' + c)
\})

input.emit('data', 'foo') // logs 'foo'
ms.mute()
input.emit('data', 'bar') // does not log 'bar'
ms.unmute()
input.emit('data', 'baz') // logs 'baz'
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Options}

All options are optional.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily replace} Set to a string to replace each character with the specified string when muted. (So you can show {\ttfamily $\ast$$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$} instead of the password, for example.)
\item {\ttfamily prompt} If you are using a replacement char, and also using a prompt with a readline stream (as for a {\ttfamily Password\+: $\ast$$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$} input), then specify what the prompt is so that backspace will work properly. Otherwise, pressing backspace will overwrite the prompt with the replacement character, which is weird.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{ms.\+mute()}

Set {\ttfamily muted} to {\ttfamily true}. Turns {\ttfamily .write()} into a no-\/op.

\subsection*{ms.\+unmute()}

Set {\ttfamily muted} to {\ttfamily false}

\subsection*{ms.\+is\+T\+TY}

True if the pipe destination is a T\+TY, or if the incoming pipe source is a T\+TY.

\subsection*{Other stream methods...}

The other standard readable and writable stream methods are all available. The Mute\+Stream object acts as a facade to its pipe source and destination.

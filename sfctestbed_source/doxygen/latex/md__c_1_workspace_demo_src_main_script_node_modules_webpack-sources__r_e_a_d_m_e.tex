Contains multiple classes which represent a {\ttfamily Source}. A {\ttfamily Source} can be asked for source code, size, source map and hash.

\subsection*{{\ttfamily Source}}

Base class for all sources.

\subsubsection*{Public methods}

All methods should be considered as expensive as they may need to do computations.

\paragraph*{{\ttfamily source}}


\begin{DoxyCode}
Source.prototype.source() -> String
\end{DoxyCode}


Returns the represented source code as string.

\paragraph*{{\ttfamily size}}


\begin{DoxyCode}
Source.prototype.size() -> Number
\end{DoxyCode}


Returns the size in chars of the represented source code.

\paragraph*{{\ttfamily map}}


\begin{DoxyCode}
Source.prototype.map(options: Object) -> Object | null
\end{DoxyCode}


Returns the Source\+Map of the represented source code as J\+S\+ON. May return {\ttfamily null} if no Source\+Map is available.

The {\ttfamily options} object can contain the following keys\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily columns\+: Boolean} (default {\ttfamily true})\+: If set to false the implementation may omit mappings for columns.
\item {\ttfamily module\+: Boolean} (default {\ttfamily true})\+: If set to false the implementation may omit inner mappings for modules.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\paragraph*{{\ttfamily source\+And\+Map}}


\begin{DoxyCode}
Source.prototype.sourceAndMap(options: Object) -> \{
    code: String,
    map: Object
\}
\end{DoxyCode}


Returns both, source code (like {\ttfamily Source.\+prototype.\+source()} and Source\+Map (like {\ttfamily Source.\+prototype.\+map()}). This method could have better performance than calling {\ttfamily source()} and {\ttfamily map()} separatly.

See {\ttfamily map()} for {\ttfamily options}.

\paragraph*{{\ttfamily update\+Hash}}


\begin{DoxyCode}
Source.prototype.updateHash(hash: Hash) -> void
\end{DoxyCode}


Updates the provided {\ttfamily Hash} object with the content of the represented source code. ({\ttfamily Hash} is an object with an {\ttfamily update} method, which is called with string values)

\paragraph*{{\ttfamily node} (optional)}


\begin{DoxyCode}
Source.prototype.node(options: Object) -> SourceNode
\end{DoxyCode}


This is an optional method. It may be {\ttfamily null} if not implemented.

Returns a {\ttfamily Source\+Node} (see source-\/map library) for the represented source code.

See {\ttfamily map()} for {\ttfamily options}.

\paragraph*{{\ttfamily list\+Node} (optional)}


\begin{DoxyCode}
Source.prototype.listNode(options: Object) -> SourceNode
\end{DoxyCode}


This is an optional method. It may be {\ttfamily null} if not implemented.

Returns a {\ttfamily Source\+List\+Map} (see source-\/list-\/map library) for the represented source code.

See {\ttfamily map()} for {\ttfamily options}.

\subsection*{{\ttfamily Raw\+Source}}

Represents source code without Source\+Map.


\begin{DoxyCode}
new RawSource(sourceCode: String)
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{{\ttfamily Original\+Source}}

Represents source code, which is a copy of the original file.


\begin{DoxyCode}
new OriginalSource(
    sourceCode: String,
    name: String
)
\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily source\+Code}\+: The source code.
\item {\ttfamily name}\+: The filename of the original source code.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Original\+Source tries to create column mappings if requested, by splitting the source code at typical statement borders ({\ttfamily ;}, {\ttfamily \{}, {\ttfamily \}}).

\subsection*{{\ttfamily Source\+Map\+Source}}

Represents source code with Source\+Map, optionally having an additional Source\+Map for the original source.


\begin{DoxyCode}
new SourceMapSource(
    sourceCode: String,
    name: String,
    sourceMap: Object | String,
    originalSource?: String,
    innerSourceMap?: Object | String
)
\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily source\+Code}\+: The source code.
\item {\ttfamily name}\+: The filename of the original source code.
\item {\ttfamily source\+Map}\+: The Source\+Map for the source code.
\item {\ttfamily original\+Source}\+: The source code of the original file. Can be omitted if the {\ttfamily source\+Map} already contains the original source code.
\item {\ttfamily inner\+Source\+Map}\+: The Source\+Map for the {\ttfamily original\+Source}/{\ttfamily name}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{{\ttfamily Line\+To\+Line\+Mapped\+Source}}

Represents source code, which is mapped line by line to the orginal file.


\begin{DoxyCode}
new LineToLineMappedSource(
    sourceCode: String,
    name: String,
    originalSource: String
)
\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily source\+Code}\+: The source code.
\item {\ttfamily name}\+: The filename of the original source code.
\item {\ttfamily original\+Source}\+: The original source code.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{{\ttfamily Cached\+Source}}

Decorates a {\ttfamily Source} and caches returned results of {\ttfamily map}, {\ttfamily source}, {\ttfamily size} and {\ttfamily source\+And\+Map} in memory. Every other operation is delegated to the wrapped {\ttfamily Source}.


\begin{DoxyCode}
new CachedSource(source: Source)
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{{\ttfamily Prefix\+Source}}

Prefix every line of the decorated {\ttfamily Source} with a provided string.


\begin{DoxyCode}
new PrefixSource(
    prefix: String,
    source: Source
)
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{{\ttfamily Concat\+Source}}

Concatenate mulitple {\ttfamily Source}s or strings to a single source.


\begin{DoxyCode}
new ConcatSource(
    ...items?: Source | String
)
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsubsection*{Public methods}

\paragraph*{{\ttfamily add}}


\begin{DoxyCode}
ConcatSource.prototype.add(item: Source | String)
\end{DoxyCode}


Adds an item to the source.

\subsection*{{\ttfamily Replace\+Source}}

Decorates a {\ttfamily Source} with replacements and insertions of source code.

\subsubsection*{Public methods}

\paragraph*{{\ttfamily replace}}


\begin{DoxyCode}
ReplaceSource.prototype.replace(
    start: Number,
    end: Number,
    replacement: String
)
\end{DoxyCode}


Replaces chars from {\ttfamily start} (0-\/indexed, inclusive) to {\ttfamily end} (0-\/indexed, inclusive) with {\ttfamily replacement}.

Locations represents locations in the original source and are not influenced by other replacements or insertions.

\paragraph*{{\ttfamily insert}}


\begin{DoxyCode}
ReplaceSource.prototype.insert(
    pos: Number,
    insertion: String
)
\end{DoxyCode}


Inserts the {\ttfamily insertion} before char {\ttfamily pos} (0-\/indexed).

Location represents location in the original source and is not influenced by other replacements or insertions.

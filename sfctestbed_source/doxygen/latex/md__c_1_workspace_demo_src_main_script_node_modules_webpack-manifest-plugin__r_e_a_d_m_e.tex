Webpack plugin for generating an asset manifest.

\href{https://circleci.com/gh/danethurber/webpack-manifest-plugin}{\tt }

\subsection*{Usage}

In your {\ttfamily webpack.\+config.\+js}


\begin{DoxyCode}
var ManifestPlugin = require('webpack-manifest-plugin');

module.exports = \{
    // ...
    plugins: [
      new ManifestPlugin()
    ]
\};
\end{DoxyCode}


This will generate a {\ttfamily manifest.\+json} file in your root output directory with a mapping of all source file names to their corresponding output file, for example\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
\{
  "mods/alpha.js": "mods/alpha.1234567890.js",
  "mods/omega.js": "mods/omega.0987654321.js"
\}
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Configuration}

A manifest is configurable using constructor options\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
new ManifestPlugin(\{
  fileName: 'my-manifest.json',
  basePath: '/app/'
\})
\end{DoxyCode}


{\bfseries Options\+:}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily file\+Name}\+: The manifest filename in your output directory ({\ttfamily manifest.\+json} by default).
\item {\ttfamily base\+Path}\+: A path prefix for all file references. Useful for including your output path in the manifest.
\item {\ttfamily public\+Path}\+: A path prefix used only on output files, similar to Webpack\textquotesingle{}s \href{https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/configuration#outputpublicpath}{\tt output.\+public\+Path}. Ignored if {\ttfamily base\+Path} was also provided.
\item {\ttfamily strip\+Src}\+: removes unwanted strings from source filenames
\item {\ttfamily write\+To\+File\+Emit}\+: If set to {\ttfamily true} will emit to build folder and memory in combination with {\ttfamily webpack-\/dev-\/server} ~\newline
$\ast$ {\ttfamily cache}\+: In \href{https://github.com/webpack/webpack/tree/master/examples/multi-compiler}{\tt multi-\/compiler mode} webpack will overwrite the manifest on each compilation. Passing a shared {\ttfamily \{\}} as the {\ttfamily cache} option into each compilation\textquotesingle{}s Manifest\+Plugin will combine the manifest between compilations. 
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{1.\+0.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item massive update -\/ separated functions into separate modules
\item functions do not accept multiple types anymore -\/ use different versions in their respective modules in some cases (eg. {\ttfamily Obj.\+map}), or use {\ttfamily chars} or {\ttfamily values} in other cases to transform into a list
\item objects are no longer transformed into functions, simply use {\ttfamily (obj.)} in Live\+Script to do that
\item browser version now using browserify -\/ use `prelude = require(\textquotesingle{}prelude-\/ls'){\ttfamily }
\item {\ttfamily added}compact{\ttfamily ,}split{\ttfamily ,}flatten{\ttfamily ,}difference{\ttfamily ,}intersection{\ttfamily ,}union{\ttfamily ,}count-\/by{\ttfamily ,}group-\/by{\ttfamily ,}chars{\ttfamily ,}unchars{\ttfamily ,}apply{\ttfamily }
\item {\ttfamily added}lists-\/to-\/obj{\ttfamily which takes a list of keys and list of values and zips them up into an object, and the converse}obj-\/to-\/lists{\ttfamily }
\item {\ttfamily added}pairs-\/to-\/obj{\ttfamily which takes a list of pairs (2 element lists) and creates an object, and the converse}obj-\/to-\/pairs{\ttfamily }
\item {\ttfamily removed}cons{\ttfamily ,}append{\ttfamily -\/ use the concat operator}
\item {\ttfamily removed}compose{\ttfamily -\/ use the compose operator}
\item {\ttfamily removed}obj-\/to-\/func{\ttfamily -\/ use partially applied access (eg.}(obj.){\ttfamily )}
\item {\ttfamily removed}length{\ttfamily -\/ use}(.length){\ttfamily  $\ast$}sort-\/by{\ttfamily renamed to}sort-\/with{\ttfamily }
\item {\ttfamily added new}sort-\/by{\ttfamily }
\item {\ttfamily removed}compare{\ttfamily -\/ just use the new}sort-\/by{\ttfamily  $\ast$}break-\/it{\ttfamily renamed}break-\/list{\ttfamily , (}Str.\+break-\/str{\ttfamily for the string version)}
\item {\ttfamily added}Str.\+repeat$<$tt$>$which creates a new string by repeating the input n times $\ast$unfold{\ttfamily as alias to}unfoldr\`{} is no longer used
\item fixed up style and compiled with Live\+Script 1.\+1.\+1
\item use Make instead of Slake
\item greatly improved tests
\end{DoxyItemize}

\item added {\ttfamily unfoldr} (alias {\ttfamily unfold})
\item calling {\ttfamily replicate} with a string now returns a list of strings
\item removed {\ttfamily partial}, just use native partial application in Live\+Script using the {\ttfamily \+\_\+} placeholder, or currying

\end{DoxyItemize}

Reduce z-\/index values with Post\+C\+SS. \end{quote}


\subsection*{Install}

With \href{https://npmjs.org/package/postcss-zindex}{\tt npm} do\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
npm install postcss-zindex --save
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Example}

Sometimes, you may introduce z-\/index values into your C\+SS that are larger than necessary, in order to improve your understanding of how each stack relates to the others. For example, you might have a modal overlay at {\ttfamily 5000} and the dialog for it at {\ttfamily 5500} -\/ so that modal classes occupy the {\ttfamily 5xxx} space.

But in production, it is unnecessary to use such large values for z-\/index where smaller values would suffice. This module will reduce all z-\/index declarations whilst respecting your original intent; such that the overlay becomes {\ttfamily 1} and the dialog becomes {\ttfamily 2}. For more examples, see the \href{test.js}{\tt tests}.

\subsubsection*{Input}


\begin{DoxyCode}
.modal \{
    z-index: 5000
\}

.modal-overlay \{
    z-index: 5500
\}
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsubsection*{Output}


\begin{DoxyCode}
.modal \{
    z-index: 1
\}

.modal-overlay \{
    z-index: 2
\}
\end{DoxyCode}


Note that this module does not attempt to normalize relative z-\/index values, such as {\ttfamily -\/1}; indeed, it will abort immediately when encountering these values as it cannot be sure that rebasing mixed positive \& negative values will keep the stacking context intact. Be careful with using this module alongside Java\+Script injected C\+SS; ideally you should have already extracted all of your stacking context into C\+SS.

\subsection*{A\+PI}

\subsubsection*{zindex(\mbox{[}options\mbox{]})}

\paragraph*{options}

\subparagraph*{start\+Index}

Type\+: {\ttfamily number} Default\+: {\ttfamily 1}

Set this to any other positive integer if you want to override z-\/indices from other sources outside your control. For example if a third party widget has a maximum z-\/index of {\ttfamily 99}, you can set this to {\ttfamily 100} and not have to worry about stacking conflicts.

\subsection*{Usage}

See the \href{https://github.com/postcss/postcss#usage}{\tt Post\+C\+SS documentation} for examples for your environment.

{\ttfamily aria-\/activedescendant} is used to manage focus within a \href{https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles#composite_header}{\tt composite widget}. The element with the attribute {\ttfamily aria-\/activedescendant} retains the active document focus; it indicates which of its child elements has secondary focus by assigning the ID of that element to the value of {\ttfamily aria-\/activedescendant}. This pattern is used to build a widget like a search typeahead select list. The search input box retains document focus so that the user can type in the input. If the down arrow key is pressed and a search suggestion is highlighted, the ID of the suggestion element will be applied as the value of {\ttfamily aria-\/activedescendant} on the input element.

Because an element with {\ttfamily aria-\/activedescendant} must be tabbable, it must either have an inherent {\ttfamily tab\+Index} of zero or declare a {\ttfamily tab\+Index} of zero with the {\ttfamily tab\+Index} attribute.

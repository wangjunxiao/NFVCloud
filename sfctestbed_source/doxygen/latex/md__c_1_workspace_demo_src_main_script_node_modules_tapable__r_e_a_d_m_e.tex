\begin{DoxyCode}
var Tapable = require("tapable");
\end{DoxyCode}


{\ttfamily Tapable} is a class for plugin binding and applying.

Just extend it.


\begin{DoxyCode}
function MyClass() \{
    Tapable.call(this);
\}

MyClass.prototype = Object.create(Tapable.prototype);

MyClass.prototype.method = function() \{\};
\end{DoxyCode}


Or mix it in.


\begin{DoxyCode}
function MyClass2() \{
    EventEmitter.call(this);
    Tapable.call(this);
\}

MyClass2.prototype = Object.create(EventEmitter.prototype);
Tapable.mixin(MyClass2.prototype);

MyClass2.prototype.method = function() \{\};
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Public functions}

\subsubsection*{apply}


\begin{DoxyCode}
void apply(plugins: Plugin...)
\end{DoxyCode}


Attaches all plugins passed as arguments to the instance, by calling {\ttfamily apply} on them.

\subsubsection*{plugin}


\begin{DoxyCode}
void plugin(names: string|string[], handler: Function)
\end{DoxyCode}


{\ttfamily names} are the names (or a single name) of the plugin interfaces the class provides.

{\ttfamily handler} is a callback function. The signature depends on the class. {\ttfamily this} is the instance of the class.

\subsection*{Protected functions}

\subsubsection*{apply\+Plugins}


\begin{DoxyCode}
void applyPlugins(name: string, args: any...)
\end{DoxyCode}


Synchronous applies all registered handers for {\ttfamily name}. The handler functions are called with all args.

\subsubsection*{apply\+Plugins\+Waterfall}


\begin{DoxyCode}
any applyPluginsWaterfall(name: string, init: any, args: any...)
\end{DoxyCode}


Synchronous applies all registered handers for {\ttfamily name}. The handler functions are called with the return value of the previous handler and all args. For the first handler {\ttfamily init} is used and the return value of the last handler is return by {\ttfamily apply\+Plugins\+Waterfall}

\subsubsection*{apply\+Plugins\+Async}


\begin{DoxyCode}
void applyPluginsAsync(
    name: string,
    args: any...,
    callback: (err?: Error) -> void
)
\end{DoxyCode}


Asynchronously applies all registered handers for {\ttfamily name}. The handler functions are called with all args and a callback function with the signature {\ttfamily (err?\+: Error) -\/$>$ void}. The hander functions are called in order of registration.

{\ttfamily callback} is called after all handlers are called.

\subsubsection*{apply\+Plugins\+Bail\+Result}


\begin{DoxyCode}
any applyPluginsBailResult(name: string, args: any...)
\end{DoxyCode}


Synchronous applies all registered handers for {\ttfamily name}. The handler function are called with all args. If a handler function returns something {\ttfamily !== undefined}, the value is returned and no more handers are applied.

\subsubsection*{apply\+Plugins\+Async\+Waterfall}


\begin{DoxyCode}
applyPluginsAsyncWaterfall(
    name: string,
    init: any,
    callback: (err: Error, result: any) -> void
)
\end{DoxyCode}


Asynchronously applies all registered handers for {\ttfamily name}. The hander functions are called with the current value and a callback function with the signature {\ttfamily (err\+: Error, next\+Value\+: any) -\/$>$ void}. When called {\ttfamily next\+Value} is the current value for the next handler. The current value for the first handler is {\ttfamily init}. After all handlers are applied, {\ttfamily callback} is called with the last value. If any handler passes a value for {\ttfamily err}, the {\ttfamily callback} is called with this error and no more handlers are called.

\subsubsection*{apply\+Plugins\+Async\+Series}


\begin{DoxyCode}
applyPluginsAsyncSeries(
    name: string,
    args: any...,
    callback: (err: Error, result: any) -> void
)
\end{DoxyCode}


Asynchronously applies all registered handers for {\ttfamily name}. The hander functions are called with all {\ttfamily args} and a callback function with the signature {\ttfamily (err\+: Error) -\/$>$ void}. The handers are called in series, one at a time. After all handlers are applied, {\ttfamily callback} is called. If any handler passes a value for {\ttfamily err}, the {\ttfamily callback} is called with this error and no more handlers are called.

\subsubsection*{apply\+Plugins\+Parallel}


\begin{DoxyCode}
applyPluginsParallel(
    name: string,
    args: any...,
    callback: (err?: Error) -> void
)
\end{DoxyCode}


Applies all registered handlers for {\ttfamily name} parallel. The handler functions are called with all args and a callback function with the signature {\ttfamily (err?\+: Error) -\/$>$ void}. The {\ttfamily callback} function is called when all handlers called the callback without {\ttfamily err}. If any handler calls the callback with {\ttfamily err}, {\ttfamily callback} is invoked with this error and the other handlers are ignored.

\subsubsection*{apply\+Plugins\+Parallel\+Bail\+Result}


\begin{DoxyCode}
applyPluginsParallelBailResult(
    name: string,
    args: any...,
    callback: (err: Error, result: any) -> void
)
\end{DoxyCode}


Applies all registered handlers for {\ttfamily name} parallel. The handler functions are called with all args and a callback function with the signature {\ttfamily (err?\+: Error) -\/$>$ void}. Handler functions must call the callback. They can either pass an error, or pass undefined, or pass an value. The first result (either error or value) with is not undefined is passed to the {\ttfamily callback}. The order is defined by registeration not by speed of the handler function. This function compentate this.

\begin{DoxyCode}
settings:
  import/resolver:
    node:

        - .js
        - .jsx
        - .es6
        - .coffee

      paths:
        # an array of absolute paths which will also be searched
        # think NODE\_PATH
        - /usr/local/share/global\_modules

      # this is technically for identifying `node\_modules` alternate names
      moduleDirectory:

        - node\_modules # defaults to 'node\_modules', but...
        - bower\_components

        - project/src  # can add a path segment here that will act like
                       # a source root, for in-project aliasing (i.e.
                       # `import MyStore from 'stores/my-store'`)

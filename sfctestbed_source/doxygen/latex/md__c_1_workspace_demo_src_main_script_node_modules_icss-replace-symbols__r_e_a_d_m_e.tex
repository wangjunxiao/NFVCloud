\section*{I\+C\+SS â€” Replace Symbols}

Governs the way tokens are searched \& replaced during the linking stage of I\+C\+SS loading.

This is broken into its own module in case the behaviour needs to be replicated in other Post\+C\+SS plugins (i.\+e. \href{https://github.com/css-modules/postcss-modules-constants}{\tt C\+SS Modules Constants})

\subsection*{A\+PI}


\begin{DoxyCode}
import replaceSymbols from "icss-replace-symbols"
replaceSymbols(css, translations)
\end{DoxyCode}


Where\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily css} is the Post\+C\+SS tree you\textquotesingle{}re working with
\item {\ttfamily translations} is an JS object of {\ttfamily symbol\+: \char`\"{}replacement\char`\"{}} pairs, where all occurrences of {\ttfamily symbol} are replaced with {\ttfamily replacement}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Behaviour}

A symbol is a string of alphanumeric, {\ttfamily -\/} or {\ttfamily \+\_\+} characters. A replacement can be any string. They are replaced in the following places\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item In the value of a declaration, i.\+e. {\ttfamily color\+: my\+\_\+symbol;} or {\ttfamily box-\/shadow\+: 0 0 blur spread shadow-\/color}
\item In a media expression i.\+e. {\ttfamily @media small \{\}} or {\ttfamily @media screen and not-\/large \{\}}
\end{DoxyItemize}

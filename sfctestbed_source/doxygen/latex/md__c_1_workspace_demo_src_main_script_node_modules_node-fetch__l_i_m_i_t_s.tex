{\itshape As of 1.\+x release}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Topics such as Cross-\/\+Origin, Content Security Policy, Mixed Content, Service Workers are ignored, given our server-\/side context.
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_u_r_l}{U\+RL}} input must be an absolute \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_u_r_l}{U\+RL}}, using either {\ttfamily http} or {\ttfamily https} as scheme.
\item On the upside, there are no forbidden headers, and {\ttfamily res.\+url} contains the final url when following redirects.
\item For convenience, {\ttfamily res.\+body} is a transform stream, so decoding can be handled independently.
\item Similarly, {\ttfamily req.\+body} can either be a string, a buffer or a readable stream.
\item Also, you can handle rejected fetch requests through checking {\ttfamily err.\+type} and {\ttfamily err.\+code}.
\item Only support {\ttfamily res.\+text()}, {\ttfamily res.\+json()}, {\ttfamily res.\+buffer()} at the moment, until there are good use-\/cases for blob/array\+Buffer.
\item There is currently no built-\/in caching, as server-\/side caching varies by use-\/cases.
\item Current implementation lacks server-\/side cookie store, you will need to extract {\ttfamily Set-\/\+Cookie} headers manually.
\item If you are using {\ttfamily res.\+clone()} and writing an isomorphic app, note that stream on Node.\+js have a smaller internal buffer size (16\+Kb, aka {\ttfamily high\+Water\+Mark}) from client-\/side browsers ($>$1\+Mb, not consistent across browsers).
\item E\+S6 features such as {\ttfamily headers.\+entries()} are missing at the moment, but you can use {\ttfamily headers.\+raw()} to retrieve the raw headers object.

A collection of tools for \href{https://w3c.github.io/ServiceWorker/}{\tt service workers} \end{quote}


Service Worker Toolbox provides some simple helpers for use in creating your own service workers. Specifically, it provides common caching strategies for dynamic content, such as A\+PI calls, third-\/party resources, and large or infrequently used local resources that you don\textquotesingle{}t want precached.

Service Worker Toolbox provides an \href{https://googlechrome.github.io/sw-toolbox/usage.html#express-style-routes}{\tt expressive approach} to using those strategies for runtime requests. If you\textquotesingle{}re not sure what service workers are or what they are for, start with https\+://github.com/slightlyoff/\+Service\+Worker/blob/master/explainer.\+md \char`\"{}the explainer doc\char`\"{}.

\subsection*{What if I need precaching as well?}

Then you should go check out \href{https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache}{\tt {\ttfamily sw-\/precache}} before doing anything else. In addition to precaching static resources, {\ttfamily sw-\/precache} supports optional \href{https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache#runtime-caching}{\tt runtime caching} through a simple, declarative configuration that incorporates Service Worker Toolbox under the hood.

\subsection*{Install}

Service Worker Toolbox is available through Bower, npm or direct from Git\+Hub\+:

{\ttfamily bower install -\/-\/save sw-\/toolbox}

{\ttfamily npm install -\/-\/save sw-\/toolbox}

{\ttfamily git clone \href{https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-toolbox.git}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/\+Google\+Chrome/sw-\/toolbox.\+git}}

\subsubsection*{Register your service worker}

From your registering page, register your service worker in the normal way. For example\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
navigator.serviceWorker.register('my-service-worker.js');
\end{DoxyCode}


As implemented in Chrome 40 or later, a service worker must exist at the root of the scope that you intend it to control, or higher. So if you want all of the pages under {\ttfamily /myapp/} to be controlled by the worker, the worker script itself must be served from either {\ttfamily /} or {\ttfamily /myapp/}. The default scope is the containing path of the service worker script.

For even lower friction, you can instead include the Service Worker Toolbox companion script in your H\+T\+ML as shown below. Be aware that this is not customizable. If you need to do anything fancier than register with a default scope, you\textquotesingle{}ll need to use the standard registration.


\begin{DoxyCode}
<script src="/path/to/sw-toolbox/companion.js" data-service-worker="my-service-worker.js"></script>
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsubsection*{Add Service Worker Toolbox to your service worker script}

In your service worker you just need to use {\ttfamily import\+Scripts} to load Service Worker Toolbox\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
importScripts('bower\_components/sw-toolbox/sw-toolbox.js');  // Update path to match your own setup.
\end{DoxyCode}

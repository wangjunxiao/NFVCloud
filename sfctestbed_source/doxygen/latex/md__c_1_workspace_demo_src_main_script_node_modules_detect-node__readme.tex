Usage\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
var isNode = require('detect-node');

if (isNode) \{
  console.log("Running under Node.JS");
\} else \{
  alert("Hello from browser (or whatever not-a-node env)");
\}
\end{DoxyCode}


The check is performed as\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
module.exports = false;

// Only Node.JS has a process variable that is of [[Class]] process
try \{
 module.exports = Object.prototype.toString.call(global.process) === '[object process]' 
\} catch(e) \{\}
\end{DoxyCode}


Thanks to Ingvar Stepanyan for the initial idea. This check is both {\bfseries the most reliable I could find} and it does not use {\ttfamily process} env directly, which would cause browserify to include it into the build.

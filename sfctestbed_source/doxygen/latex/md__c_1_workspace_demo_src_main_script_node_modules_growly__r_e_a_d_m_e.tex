Simple zero-\/dependency Growl notifications using G\+N\+TP.

\subsection*{Installation}

Install growly using {\ttfamily npm}\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
npm install growly
\end{DoxyCode}


And then require it\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
var growly = require('growly');
\end{DoxyCode}


This module uses the Growl Network Transport Protocol (G\+N\+TP) which was implemented in Growl since version 1.\+3, so you {\bfseries must have an appropriate version of Growl installed} for Growly to work.

\subsection*{Example}

Sending a minimal Growl notification\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
var growly = require('growly');

growly.notify('This is as easy as it gets', \{ title: 'Hello, World!' \});
\end{DoxyCode}


More examples can be found in the {\itshape example/} directory.

\subsection*{Usage}

The growly module exposes only three methods\+: {\ttfamily Growly.\+register()}, {\ttfamily Growly.\+notify()}, and {\ttfamily Growly.\+set\+Host()}.

\subsubsection*{Growly.\+register(appname, \mbox{[}appicon\mbox{]}, \mbox{[}notifications\mbox{]}, \mbox{[}callback\mbox{]})}

Registers a new application with Growl. Registration is completely optional since it will be performed automatically for you with sensible defaults. Useful if you want your application, with its own icon and types of notifications, to show up in Growl\textquotesingle{}s prefence panel.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily appname} the name of the application (required.)
\item {\ttfamily appicon} url, file path, or Buffer instance for an application icon image.
\item {\ttfamily notifications} a list of defined notification types with the following properties\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily .label} name used to identify the type of notification being used (required.)
\item {\ttfamily .dispname} name users will see in Growl\textquotesingle{}s preference panel (defaults to {\ttfamily .label}.)
\item {\ttfamily .enabled} whether or not notifications of this type are enabled (defaults to true.)
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily callback} called when the registration completes; if registration fails, the first argument will be an Error object.
\end{DoxyItemize}

An example\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
growly.register('My Application', 'path/to/icon.png', [
    \{ label: 'success', dispname: 'Success' \},
    \{ label: 'warning', dispname: 'Warning', enabled: false \}
], function(err) \{
    console.log(err || 'Registration successful!');
\});
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsubsection*{Growly.\+notify(text, \mbox{[}opts\mbox{]}, \mbox{[}callback\mbox{]})}

Sends a Growl notification. If an application wasn\textquotesingle{}t registered beforehand with {\ttfamily growly.\+register()}, a default application will automatically be registered beforesending the notification.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily text} the body of the notification.
\item {\ttfamily opts} an object with the following properties\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily .title} title of the notification.
\item {\ttfamily .icon} url, file path, or Buffer instance for the notification\textquotesingle{}s icon.
\item {\ttfamily .sticky} whether or not to sticky the notification (defaults to false.)
\item {\ttfamily .label} type of notification to use (defaults to the first registered notification type.)
\item {\ttfamily .priority} the priority of the notification from lowest (-\/2) to highest (2).
\item {\ttfamily .coalescing\+Id} replace/update the matching previous notification. May be ignored.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily callback} called when the user has closed/clicked the notification. The callback is passed an Error object {\ttfamily err} as the first argument when the notification fails; otherwise, the second argument {\ttfamily action} is a string that\textquotesingle{}ll describe which action has been taken by the user (either \textquotesingle{}closed\textquotesingle{} or \textquotesingle{}clicked\textquotesingle{}.)
\end{DoxyItemize}

An example\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
/* Assuming an application was registered with a notification type labeled 'warning'. */
growly.notify('Stuffs broken!', \{ label: 'warning' \}, function(err, action) \{
    console.log('Action:', action);
\});
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsubsection*{Growly.\+set\+Host(host, port)}

Set the host and port that Growl (G\+N\+TP) requests will be sent to. Using this method is optional since G\+N\+TP defaults to using host \textquotesingle{}localhost\textquotesingle{} and port 23053.

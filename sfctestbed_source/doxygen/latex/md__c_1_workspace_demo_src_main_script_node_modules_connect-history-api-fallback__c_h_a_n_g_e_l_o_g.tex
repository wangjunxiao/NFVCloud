\subsection*{v1.\+0.\+0}

This version introduces a fair amount of breaking changes. Specifically, instances of the history\+Api\+Fallback need to be created via the exported function. Previously, this was not necessary.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries Breaking\+:} Support multiple instances of the history\+Api\+Fallback middleware with different configurations.
\item {\bfseries Breaking\+:} Loggers are configured per history\+Api\+Fallback middleware instance (see {\ttfamily R\+E\+A\+D\+M\+E.\+md}).
\item The fallback index H\+T\+ML file can be configured. Default is {\ttfamily /index.html}.
\item Additional rewrite rules can be defined via regular expressions.

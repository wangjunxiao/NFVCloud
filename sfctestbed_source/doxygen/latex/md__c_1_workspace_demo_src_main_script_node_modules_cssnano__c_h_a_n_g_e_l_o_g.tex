\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item cssnano will no longer {\ttfamily console.\+warn} any messages when using deprecated options; these are now sent to Post\+C\+SS. You will be able to see them if you use a Post\+C\+SS runner with built-\/in messages support, or alternately by loading {\ttfamily postcss-\/reporter} or {\ttfamily postcss-\/browser-\/reporter} in your plugins list.
\item Prepares support for {\ttfamily grid} identifier reduction by adding it to the list of optimisations turned off when {\ttfamily options.\+safe} is set to {\ttfamily true}.
\item Adds support for normalizing {\ttfamily unicode-\/range} descriptors. Values will be converted when the code matches {\ttfamily 0} \& {\ttfamily f} in the same place on both sides of the range. So, {\ttfamily u+2000-\/2fff} can be converted to {\ttfamily u+2???}, but {\ttfamily u+2100-\/2fff} will be left as it is.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{3.\+9.\+1}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Resolves an integration issue with {\ttfamily v3.\+9.\+0}, where {\ttfamily undefined} values would attempt to be parsed.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{3.\+9.\+0}

\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{3.\+8.\+2}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Resolves an issue where {\ttfamily display\+: list-\/item inline flow} would be normalized to {\ttfamily inline list-\/item} rather than {\ttfamily inline-\/list-\/item} (thanks to ).
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{3.\+8.\+1}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Adds a quick start file for easy integration with Runkit. Try cssnano online at \href{https://runkit.com/npm/cssnano}{\tt https\+://runkit.\+com/npm/cssnano}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{3.\+8.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}

\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{3.\+7.\+4}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Improves performance of the reduce\+Positions transform by testing against {\ttfamily has\+Own\+Property} instead of using an array of object keys.
\item Removes the redundant {\ttfamily indexes-\/of} dependency.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{3.\+7.\+3}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Unpins postcss-\/filter-\/plugins from {\ttfamily 2.\+0.\+0} as a fix has landed in the new version of uniqid.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{3.\+7.\+2}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Temporarily pins postcss-\/filter-\/plugins to version {\ttfamily 2.\+0.\+0} in order to mitigate an issue with uniqid {\ttfamily 3.\+0.\+0}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{3.\+7.\+1}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Enabling safe mode now turns off both postcss-\/merge-\/idents \& postcss-\/normalize-\/url\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily strip\+W\+WW} option.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{3.\+7.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added\+: Reduce {\ttfamily background-\/repeat} definitions; works with both this property \& the {\ttfamily background} shorthand, and aims to compress the extended two value syntax into the single value syntax.
\item Added\+: Reduce {\ttfamily initial} values for properties when the {\itshape actual} initial value is shorter; for example, {\ttfamily min-\/width\+: initial} becomes {\ttfamily min-\/width\+: 0}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{3.\+6.\+2}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed an issue where cssnano would crash on {\ttfamily steps(1)}.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added {\ttfamily postcss-\/discard-\/overridden} to safely discard overridden rules with the same identifier (thanks to ).
\item Added\+: Reduce animation/transition timing functions. Detects {\ttfamily cubic-\/bezier} functions that are equivalent to the timing keywords and compresses, as well as normalizing the {\ttfamily steps} timing function.
\item Added the {\ttfamily perspective-\/origin} property to the list of supported properties transformed by the {\ttfamily reduce-\/positions} transform.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{3.\+5.\+2}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Resolves an issue where the 3 or 4 value syntax for {\ttfamily background-\/position} were being incorrectly converted.

\section*{3.\+3.\+2}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixes an issue where using {\ttfamily options.\+safe} threw an error when cssnano was not used as part of a Post\+C\+SS instance, but standalone (such as in modules like gulp-\/cssnano). cssnano now renames {\ttfamily safe} internally to {\ttfamily is\+Safe}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{3.\+3.\+1}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Unpins postcss-\/colormin from {\ttfamily 2.\+1.\+2}, as the {\ttfamily 2.\+1.\+3} \& {\ttfamily 2.\+1.\+4} patches had optimization regressions that are now resolved in {\ttfamily 2.\+1.\+5}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{3.\+3.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Updated modules to use postcss-\/value-\/parser version 3 (thanks to ).
\item Now converts between transform functions with postcss-\/reduce-\/transforms. e.\+g. {\ttfamily translate3d(0, 0, 0)} becomes {\ttfamily translate\+Z(0)}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{3.\+2.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item cssnano no longer converts {\ttfamily outline\+: none} to {\ttfamily outline\+: 0}, as there are some cases where the values are not equivalent (thanks to ).
\item cssnano no longer converts for example {\ttfamily 16px} to {\ttfamily 1pc} {\itshape by default}. Length optimisations can be turned on via {\ttfamily \{convert\+Values\+: \{length\+: true\}\}}.
\item Improved minimization of css functions (thanks to ).
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{3.\+1.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This release swaps postcss-\/single-\/charset for postcss-\/normalize-\/charset, which can detect encoding to determine whether a charset is necessary. Optionally, you can set the {\ttfamily add} option to {\ttfamily true} to prepend a U\+T\+F-\/8 charset to the output automatically (thanks to ).
\item A {\ttfamily safe} option was added, which disables more aggressive optimisations, as a convenient preset configuration (thanks to ).
\item Added an option to convert from {\ttfamily deg} to {\ttfamily turn} \& vice versa, \& improved minification performance in functions (thanks to ).
\end{DoxyItemize}

\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{3.\+0.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item All cssnano plugins and cssnano itself have migrated to Post\+C\+SS 5.\+x. Please make sure that when using the 3.\+x releases that you use a 5.\+x compatible Post\+C\+SS runner.
\item cssnano will now compress inline S\+VG through S\+V\+GO. Because of this change, interfacing with cssnano must now be done through an asynchronous A\+PI. The main {\ttfamily process} method has the same signature as a Post\+C\+SS processor instance.
\item The old options such as {\ttfamily merge} \& {\ttfamily fonts} that were deprecated in release {\ttfamily 2.\+5.\+0} were removed. The new architecture allows you to specify any module name to disable it.
\item postcss-\/minify-\/selectors\textquotesingle{} at-\/rule compression was extracted out into postcss-\/minify-\/params (thanks to ).
\item Overall performance of the module has improved dramatically, thanks to work by  and input from the community.

\item cssnano will not merge properties together that have an {\ttfamily inherit} keyword.
\item postcss-\/minify-\/font-\/weight \& postcss-\/font-\/family were consolidated into postcss-\/minify-\/font-\/values. Using the old options will print deprecation warnings (thanks to ).
\item The cssnano C\+LI was extracted into a separate module, so that dependent modules such as gulp-\/cssnano don\textquotesingle{}t download unnecessary extras.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{2.\+6.\+1}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Improved performance of the core module {\ttfamily function\+Optimiser}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{2.\+6.\+0}

\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{2.\+5.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Adds support for disabling modules of the user\textquotesingle{}s choosing, with new option names. The old options (such as {\ttfamily merge} \& {\ttfamily fonts}) will be removed in {\ttfamily 3.\+0}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{2.\+4.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}

\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{2.\+0.\+3}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item cssnano can now be consumed with the parentheses-\/less method in Post\+C\+SS; e.\+g. {\ttfamily postcss(\mbox{[} cssnano \mbox{]})}.
\item Fixes an issue where \textquotesingle{}Din\textquotesingle{} was being picked up by the logic as a numeric value, causing the full font name to be incorrectly rearranged.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Adds removal of outdated vendor prefixes based on browser support.
\item Addresses an issue where relative path separators were converted to backslashes on Windows.
\item cssnano will now detect previous plugins and silently disable them when the functionality overlaps. This is to enable faster interoperation with cssnext.
\item cssnano now exports as a Post\+C\+SS plugin. The simple interface is exposed at {\ttfamily cssnano.\+process(css, opts)} instead of {\ttfamily cssnano(css, opts)}.
\item Improved \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_u_r_l}{U\+RL}} detection when using two or more in the same declaration.

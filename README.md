## Overview

The sfctestbed is a OpenStack based sfc testbed platform, developed by vnetlab team in dlut. You can deploy the sfctestbed on a OpenStack cluster with nodes connected by a simple commodity L2 switch and L3 router. On the platform, each user can define multiple service function chaining instances, each of which consists of a series of virtualized network functions and internal overlay links. You can manipulate the lifecyle orchestration of the service function chaining by GUI operation.
